[Train Scheduler](https://meganthonykeogh.github.io/trainSchedule/)

This application gives you the current time(EST) and allows you to add trains to the schedule. 

I used firebase to save the trains added to the schedule by the user. I'm using moment.js for the time (and the time out interval) to keep the time up-to-date. 

In the future, I would like to add some form validation and some javascript to keep the train's minutes away feature to-to-date.
